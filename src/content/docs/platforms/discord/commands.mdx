## 4) /ask

The `/ask` command is used to explicitly ask a question to the C12s bot.

<Badge text="Note" variant="tip" /> Organizations under the Free plan have to use the `/ask` command (or @tag the bot) to ask questions to it, while organizations under any paid plan do not require this command nor mention (users can simply ask a question in natural language and the bot will automatically pick it up and answer if it has knowledge to do so).

## 5) /sync
