## Ask

The `/ask` command is used to explicitly ask a question to the C12s bot.

<Badge text="Note" variant="tip" /> Organizations under the Free plan have to use the `/ask` command (or @tag the bot) to ask questions to it, while organizations under any paid plan do not require this command nor mention (users can simply ask a question in natural language and the bot will automatically pick it up and answer if it has knowledge to do so).

## Sync

The `/sync` command is used to force-sync the C12s Discord with any changes that you made in the [C12s webapp](https://app.c12s.ai?r=docs).
This should not be needed, as the bot automatically syncs with changes done via the webapp. But if you notice a discrepancy, you can use this command to force a sync.
