## 3) Linking the Discord Bot to your C12s Organization

To link the bot to your C12s Organization, you need to go to the [C12s App](https://app.c12s.ai), go to the "Settings" page, hover your mouse over the connect button and select "Discord".

After Selecting discord you should receive a prompt with the verification code. like the following:

```text
/verify bdhujgb
```

You will **need** to copy the code, go over to discord and access a channel that the bot has access to and type `/verify`, you will see an empty box where you will insert the code.
