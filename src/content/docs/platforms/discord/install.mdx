## 1) Adding the C12s Bot to your server

To add the C12s bot to your server, you have two methods, via the [C12s App](https://app.c12s.ai) hover over the connect button and select "Discord", it will open a new prompt where you can click the "Invite Bot" and you will be directed to the Discord invite page or press [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1287755859690262588&permissions=8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.c12s.ai%2Fconnect&scope=bot) to directly open the Discord invite page.

The second method is to have a common server with the C12s bot, open the C12s bot profile and press the "Add App" button to invite the bot to your server.

## 3) Linking the Discord Bot to your C12s Organization

To link the bot to your C12s Organization, you need to go to the [C12s App](https://app.c12s.ai), go to the "Settings" page, hover your mouse over the connect button and select "Discord".

![Use the /verify command](src/assets/screenshots/platforms/discord/copy-code.gif)

After Selecting Discord you should receive a prompt with the verification code. like the following:

```text
/verify bdhujgb
```

You will **need** to copy the code, go over to Discord and access a channel that the bot has access to and type `/verify`, you will see an empty box where you will insert the code.

After typing the code, the bot should appear as connected in the C12s App.

**Footnotes**

[^1]: The bot can create a channel (upon user request) for auditing/logging/alerting purposes.
[^2]: Not currently needed as the bot does not have such functionalities yet; in the future we might give it certain added abilities to make it more useful to admins.
