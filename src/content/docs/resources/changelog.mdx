---

## Version 1.3.0
Released: 2025-10-23

##### Added
- New Statistics graph: Community Growth (Joins/Leaves)

---

## Version 1.2.0
Released: 2025-10-21

##### Added
- Added new content moderation pattern rules (new content-types for user-bot messages and system messages).
- PostHog integration to properly attribute referral websites to signed-up customers (_laying the ground work for more advanced internal analytics and eventually creating a referral program_).

#### Fixed
- The 'Community Engagement' graph now works properly (tracking DAUs on Discord and Telegram). _More updates are coming to this section._
- The 'Community Activity' graph now displays gray squares for hours in the future (when no data is available), with a nice tooltip.
- Removed the trend lines on the graphs until they are functional.
- Improved login/signup error handling.
- Regular Expressions now automatically include the 'm' flag (multiline).
- The bot now executes the chosen actions when a user `/report`s a message (previously it was only logging the report).
- The 'demo mode' integration ([+info here](/organization/integrations/#demo-mode)) now properly does **not** count towards plans connection limits (_use it for testing!_).

## Version 1.1.1
Released: 2025-10-17

#### Fixed
- We introduced a regression with the last 'mobile refresh' update, which caused issues in the 'Unanswered Questions' [dashboard](/getting-started/core-concepts/#dashboard) when a question was too large (without any spaces, such as a long URL). This has now been fixed.

---

## Version 1.1.0
Released: 2025-10-12

##### Added
- New badge on the bottom right corner with the current version number.
- New feature: [Community self-moderation](/getting-started/core-concepts/#community-self-reporting) via the `/report` command (disabled by default).

#### Fixed
- We made our webapp generally more mobile-friendly. While a few minor features remain 'desktop-only', most of the app should now work seamlessly on mobile devices.
- Added the same SEO as our homepage to the webapp, so our webapp links (specially the invites) are prettier when shared.

---

## Version 1.0.0
Released: 2025-10-07

This release marks the initial release of C12s, finally opening the door to the public, after over a year of development behind closed doors with several large teams.

#### Added
- New section "Moderation Policies & Rules"; tip: check the [spam protection](/moderation/spam-protection) article.

#### Fixed
- In the [statistics section](/analytics/dashboards), most graphs stopped working a few weeks ago due to a backend migration. This has now been fixed and the first and last graph are now functioning properly.
- Because registrations are now open, organization invites now work properly without requiring any intervention from our side.
- We switched authentication systems (from a 3rd-party provider to our own using BetterAuth's library).
