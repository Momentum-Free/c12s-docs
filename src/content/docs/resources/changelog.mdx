description: A comprehensive list of changes and updates to the C12S platform.

## Version 1.4.0
Released: 2025-11-07

This release doesn't include any user-facing changes; it's just in preparation for the next larger release (1.5.0), and we'll include some minor fixes in this version soon too.

#### Fixed
- We rebuilt a large portion of our backend API to prepare it for supporting streaming endpoints (better UX from slower inference providers, Telegram even supports streaming natively! so expect that to come to our TG bot too soon);
- We will be adding better 'agentic capabilities' to C12s in the next upcoming releases (thanks to this refactor), allowing it to interact with other systems and services more intelligently with higher contextual awareness;
- We now trace embeddings as well (this gives us better visibility into the embedding model/provider time taken; we can benchmark different providers and models better, etc.);

---

### Version 1.3.3
Released: 2025-11-06

##### Added
- Unanswered Questions on the dashboard now have a column that indicates if they were sent on Discord or Telegram; on hover, they will display the name of the group/server and channel;

#### Fixed
- The 'go to' button [↗️] on the dashboard now correctly navigates to the corresponding message (Discord messages weren't being linked properly at all, and Telegram ones weren't being formatted correctly for public groups).

---

### Version 1.3.2
Released: 2025-11-03

##### Added
- Discord bot → Added a new 'Try again without sources.' button when the AI can't find relevant Knowledge Base entries. This button will try asking the model directly (prone to hallucinations unless the question is something the LLM knows intrinsically);
- Discord bot → (feature-flagged for now, let us know if you'd like to try it): New 'raw_llm' command to execute "raw prompts" to the LLM; useful when testing custom endpoints/models.
- BYOK support → We added backend support for 'Bring Your Own Keys' (BYOK), so you can use your own self-hosted/finetuned models with our platform. BYOK is under closed Beta, please contact us if this is important for you.

#### Fixed
- Fixed issues found with our Discord bot's writing "thread mode";
- AI responses larger than 2000 characters are now split at the nearest paragraph	boundary, so large messages are sent in multiple parts.
- Billing page → Fixed an issue where the billing stats for 'Analysed Messages' was not displaying correctly.

---

### Version 1.3.1
Released: 2025-10-25

##### Added
- Stats → Community Growth: Added a view toggle to switch between Last 24 hours and Last 7 days graphs.
- Stats → Community Growth: Simplified the tooltip—platforms with 0 values are hidden.

#### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where Discord channel permissions overlapped with their parent category, causing unexpected access errors.
- Fixed a bug in Stats where admin messages were being counted twice.

---

## Version 1.3.0
Released: 2025-10-23

##### Added
- New Statistics graph: Community Growth (Joins/Leaves)
- Community Engagement graph now has a toggle for WAU's (weekly active users);

#### Fixed
- Webapp colors now match the logo;
- "Report feature" renamed to "Community Self-Report" and now links to the relevant documentation page;

---

## Version 1.2.0
Released: 2025-10-21

##### Added
- Added new content moderation pattern rules (new content-types for user-bot messages and system messages).
- PostHog integration to properly attribute referral websites to signed-up customers (_laying the ground work for more advanced internal analytics and eventually creating a referral program_).

#### Fixed
- The 'Community Engagement' graph now works properly (tracking DAUs on Discord and Telegram). _More updates are coming to this section._
- The 'Community Activity' graph now displays gray squares for hours in the future (when no data is available), with a nice tooltip.
- Removed the trend lines on the graphs until they are functional.
- Improved login/signup error handling.
- Regular Expressions now automatically include the 'm' flag (multiline).
- The bot now executes the chosen actions when a user `/report`s a message (previously it was only logging the report).
- The 'demo mode' integration ([+info here](/organization/integrations/#demo-mode)) now properly does **not** count towards plans connection limits (_use it for testing!_).

---

### Version 1.1.1
Released: 2025-10-17

#### Fixed
- We introduced a regression with the last 'mobile refresh' update, which caused issues in the 'Unanswered Questions' [dashboard](/getting-started/core-concepts/#dashboard) when a question was too large (without any spaces, such as a long URL). This has now been fixed.

---

## Version 1.1.0
Released: 2025-10-12

##### Added
- New badge on the bottom right corner with the current version number.
- New feature: [Community self-moderation](/getting-started/core-concepts/#community-self-reporting) via the `/report` command (disabled by default).

#### Fixed
- We made our webapp generally more mobile-friendly. While a few minor features remain 'desktop-only', most of the app should now work seamlessly on mobile devices.
- Added the same SEO as our homepage to the webapp, so our webapp links (specially the invites) are prettier when shared.

---

## Version 1.0.0
Released: 2025-10-07

This release marks the initial release of C12s, finally opening the door to the public, after over a year of development behind closed doors with several large teams.

#### Added
- New section "Moderation Policies & Rules"; tip: check the [spam protection](/moderation/spam-protection) article.

#### Fixed
- In the [statistics section](/analytics/dashboards), most graphs stopped working a few weeks ago due to a backend migration. This has now been fixed and the first and last graph are now functioning properly.
- Because registrations are now open, organization invites now work properly without requiring any intervention from our side.
- We switched authentication systems (from a 3rd-party provider to our own using BetterAuth's library).
