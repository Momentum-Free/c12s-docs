## Account & Billing

Under the "Settings" button on the top menu, pick the "Billing" menu option.

You can see your current subscription plan, how far you've used it, and how far you are from reaching the limits of analyzed messages and answers per month.

Below the current plan description, you'll see an "Upgrade Now" button. This takes you to a Stripe-hosted management page where you can:
 * update or cancel your C12s subscription
 * add/remove payment methods
 * Define preferred payment method
 * Update your company's billing information
 * View your payment history

If you select the "Update subscription" option you will be shown all available plans (all with monthly or yearly billing options) and the respective limits for each plan. After you select the plan that fits your organization's needs, you will be redirected to the payment screen and then to the order confirmation.

As soon as the payment is confirmed (should be immediate), your subscription will be updated and you will have access to all the features of the selected plan.

### Failed renewal

In case the renewal subscription fails, you will receive a notification inside your [C12s webapp](https://app.c12s.ai?r=docs), informing you of the billing issues, and if you do not correct the issue you will be downgraded to the Free plan.
