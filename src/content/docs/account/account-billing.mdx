Below the current plan description you will have the "Upgrade Now" option, this will redirect you to the billing details, here you are able to:
 * update or cancel your C12s subscription
 * add/remove payment methods
 * Define preferred payment method
 * Check your billing information
 * Payment history

If you select the "Update subscription" option you will be shown all available plans (all with monthly or yearly billing options) and the respective limits for each plan, after you select the plan that fits your organization needs, you will be redirected to the payment screen and then to the order confirmation.
