## Knowledge Page

To start adding knowledge to your c12s organization, you first need to go into the [C12s App](https://app.c12s.ai) and open your organization page.

Once you have your organization page open, on the top menu you will see an option called "Knowledge Base", you need to click to be redirected to your knowledge base page.

On this page you can do a few things, like:

1) Create a new entry;
2) Edit an existing entry;
3) Delete an existing entry;
4) Ask questions and you will be able to how much your question matches an existing entry.

## 1) Creating knowledge entries

Now to actually create a new knowledge entry you have two options:

1) Manual Process

In order to manually add knowledge entries you will first need to press the "+ Knowledge" button, this will take you to the creation page.

On this page you have a few fields you can fill out, but the only mandatory ones are the title and answer. The questions can be manually filled out or you can ask the AI to generate the questions based on the information you gave it. The source field is useful to keep track of where you found the information.

2) AI Process

The AI process is more straight forward than the manual one, to use the AI process you need to press the "..." button right next to the "+ Knowledge" button, and select the "import" option, this will redirect you to a new page named "Data Import".

Here you can add all the urls you find relevant to your organization, and the AI will generate the knowledge entries for you, based on the information found on the urls.

After the knowledge entries are generated, you can select how the bot should use each of them, if he should ignore, use them to generate replies or to simply paste the answer you gave him.

## 2) Editing knowledge entries

After the knowledge entries are generated, you can edit them at any time, you just need to press the pencil icon located in the right side of each entry and it will take you back to the page you used to create it, however, this time it will be filled with all the information you added.

## 4) Ask questions/ Search

In the knowledge base page you have a search bar in the top part of the page, followed by two buttons:

1) The "Regular Text Search" that works like any normal search feature
2) The "AI Semantic Search", this option will grab the text you inserted in the search bar and will compare it to all the knowledge entries that exist in your organization, and will give you a score based on how much the entries answer your question.
