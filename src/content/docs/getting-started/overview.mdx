C12s is an **AI community manager and moderator agent** for community-centric businesses. It answers user questions 24/7 in multiple languages, filters spam/scams, and gives your team **analytics and workflows** to run Discord, Telegram, and Slack communities with confidence.

This page orients you to core ideas and the fastest route to value.

## What you can do with C12s

- **Instant answers, on-brand** — Pull from your **Knowledge Base** (files, docs, URLs, FAQs) and **real-time APIs** (*soon*) to answer accurately in public channels.  
- **Moderation & safety** — Flag and remove spam/scams, enforce rules and optionally enable community self-moderation.  
- **Automations & workflows** — Triage tickets, set autoresponses, and connect downstream tools via webhooks (*soon*).  
- **Reporting & analytics** — Track AI performance, moderator efficiency, sentiment, schedule recurring reports, and surface hotspots to fix (*soon*).
- **Multiple platforms** - You can connect all supported platforms (Discord, Telegram & Slack) to the same organization and reuse the same Knowledge Base and Moderation Policies across all of them simultaneously.

> **Outcome first:** Start with a safe, minimal setup. Add depth as your needs grow.

## Who this is for

- **Founders / Community Managers:** Ship a reliable multi-lingual support experience without hiring a 24/7 team.  
- **Moderators:** Reduce repetitive Q&A, scam-banning and chat-cleaning, and focus on judgment calls, community building and genuine value-add interactions. 
{/* - **Developers:** Integrate events, webhooks, and APIs to extend C12s into your stack. */}

## How C12s works (high level)

<Steps>

1. **Connect a platform** (Discord/Telegram/Slack Beta) to your **organization**.  
2. **Create a Knowledge Base** by adding **sources** (files, URLs, FAQs). You can also use **Shared Knowledge Bases** across different projects under the same ecosystem or even the same company.  
3. **Choose moderation policies** (e.g., set community rules, spam triggers & actions, escalations) and optional **automations** (autoresponses, scheduled messages (soon), self-moderation).  
4. **Go live** and review **Reporting & Analytics** to iterate.

</Steps>

## Key terms at a glance

- **Community**: Where your brand's users interact. We currently support Discord (servers), Telegram (groups), and Slack (workspaces).
- **Organization**: Your top-level workspace in C12s. One user can have multiple organizations (e.g., one for each product or brand, or even per client (e.g. a marketing agency)).  
- **Agent**: The AI that reads events, consults your Knowledge Base, applies Policies, and responds or escalates.  
- **Knowledge Base (KB)**: A collection of Sources and Entries used to answer questions.  
- **Shared KB***: A knowledge base that can be reused across different organizations (e.g. a Solana KB for all Solana projects to benefit from as a shared knowledge resource).  
- **Policy**: Your rules for moderation actions (allow, warn, delete, escalate).  
- **Automation**: Time- or event-based actions (e.g., scheduled canned messages*, community reports, autoresponses, ticket triage*, webhooks*).  
- **Reporting**: Analytics Dashboards and AI-generated reports* from community sentiment to surface hotspots and trends.

> (*) Note: Some of these features are currently in beta and may have limitations or require additional configuration.

## Recommended first setup (3-5 minutes)

<Steps>

1. **Create a project** in our dashboard and optionally invite your team (_one free organization is automatically created for every new user_).  
2. **Connect your Organization to your community's platform** (Discord, Telegram, etc.).
3. **Seed your Knowledge Base** with 10–20 different entries that your users ask most, or add a URL Source from your main website, FAQ page or docs.  
4. **Demo the product** in a private test group or channel and ask 3–5 real user questions which should be covered by your seeded Knowledge Base.  
5. **Turn on baseline moderation** (spam/scam presets) and add the Community Rules.  
6. **Review reporting after 48–72 hours** and adjust sources/policies.

</Steps>

## Best-practice launch patterns

- **Start in a sandbox** (test server/channel) before going public.  
- **One source of truth** — store canonical answers in the KB; avoid ad-hoc “manual replies” drift.  
- **Short feedback loop** — use analytics, look at the list of 'unanswered questions' and message audits daily in week 1, then weekly.  
- **Gradual rollout** — Limit auto-replies to a few select channels (Discord) → full automation across the community once confident.
