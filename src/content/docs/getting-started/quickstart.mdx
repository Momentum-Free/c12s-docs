Time: **2–5 minutes** · Result: your bot answers a real question in your community.

> If you prefer a broader intro first, see the **[Overview](/getting-started/overview/)**.  
> For deeper theory later, jump to **[Core Concepts](/getting-started/core-concepts/)**.

## 1) Sign in

Sign in at **[app.c12s.ai](https://app.c12s.ai?r=docs)** with **Google**, **Discord**, or **Telegram**.  
We only use trusted OAuth providers—**no passwords** to reduce credential risk.

![Provider sign-in options](@/assets/screenshots/getting-started/sso-login.png)

> **Invited by a teammate?** If you haven’t used C12s before, you’ll create an account and a default org (e.g., “Your Name’s Team”). After you accept the invite, you may see **two organizations**. Use the org switcher ([top-right](@/assets/screenshots/getting-started/org-switcher.png)) to select the correct one and rename/leave the extra later (see step 2).

---

## 2) Name your organization

Go to **Settings → General** and:
- **Rename** your org to your company/brand.
- Add a short **description** (1–2 paragraphs).
- (Optional) **Upload a logo**.

![Org settings](@/assets/screenshots/getting-started/general-org-settings.png)

> **Tip:** Clear names reduce confusion when you belong to multiple orgs.

---

## 3) Connect your first community

On **Settings → Integrations**, click **Connect** and pick a platform.

![Connect button](@/assets/screenshots/getting-started/integrations-connect-button.gif)

You’ll see a verification prompt like:

```text
/verify <code>
```

<Steps>
1. **Add the C12s bot** to your community.
</Steps>
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Discord">Follow the [Discord install guide](/platforms/discord/install/).</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Telegram">Follow the [Telegram setup guide](/platforms/telegram/setup/).</TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Slack (Beta)">Follow the [Slack (Beta) guide](/platforms/slack/).</TabItem>
</Tabs>
<Steps>
2. Within the community's chat, paste the **/verify** command with your code.
3. Return to C12s — your community will appear as **connected**.
</Steps>

{/* Note to Rui: the verify modal is currently under development to include adding the bot links in it, so the screenshot isn't ready yet

![Verify modal](../../assets/qs-verify.png)
*/}

> **Permissions checklist (minimum):** the bot must **read messages** and **send messages** in channels you want it to operate in. For Discord, ensure **Read Message History** is allowed. If you wish to use Moderation features, ensure the relevant permissions are given as well.

---

## 4) Choose the bot’s behavior

In **Settings → AI Configuration**:

* **Personality:** pick a preset (e.g., *Short & Friendly*), or create a Custom one.
* **Read / Write / Learn:**

  * **Read** → allow the bot to read all messages by default (you can hide private/sensitive channels in the **Overrides** section).
  * **Write** →
    * *Passive* (default for free orgs): replies only when explicitly prompted (@tagged or /ask).
    * *Active* (recommended for paid orgs): answers automatically when a relevant Knowledge Entry is found.
  * **Learn** → auto-learn from staff replies (toggle as desired).

![AI Write Modes](@/assets/screenshots/getting-started/ai-write-modes.gif)

> **Discord/Slack channel overrides:** use **Overrides** to fine-tune Read/Write/Learn per channel (handy for announcements or private areas).

---

## 5) Seed your Knowledge Base

Go to **Knowledge Base** and start with either path:

**A. Create manual entries (fastest)**

* Click **+ Knowledge** → write a concise **Answer** for one topic (pricing, access, roadmap, troubleshooting, policies, etc.).
* Add a few **Questions** that users might ask regarding this piece of Knowledge (suggestion: use **Generate Questions** to get automatically get a list of questions you can edit).

<Badge text="Tip" variant="tip" /> See [Core Concepts - Knowledge Entry](/getting-started/core-concepts/#knowledge-entry) for a full explanation of all fields.

**B. Import sources**

* Add a **URL** to ingest product pages, docs, or PDFs. The process usually takes less than a minute to complete.
* (Paid) **Web search with whitelisted domains** lets you reference a whole site (e.g., your docs/blog) without importing every page individually.

{/* ![Knowledge table empty](../../assets/qs-kb-empty.png) */}
{/* ![Entry with generated questions](../../assets/qs-kb-entry.png) */}

> **Starter set:** 10–20 topics that cover 80% of common questions is ideal for a first pass.

---

## 6) Sanity-check with Semantic Search

Still on **Knowledge Base**, type a typical user question in the **Search** bar and click the **✨** button.

* If you see a **match with a high similarity score** (≈ **70%+**), the bot would use that source to answer in your community.
* **No match?** Add/adjust the entry's **Questions** (phrasing matters for recall); too short questions will likely trigger more often (may increase false triggers), while too long ones will likely trigger less often (may miss relevant questions that could've been answered otherwise).

## 7) Ask it live

Go to your connected community and ask the same question.

* In **Passive** write mode: **explicitly prompt** the bot (e.g., mention it or use your bot’s /ask command); if no match is found, it will reply with a canned message that it doesn't know the answer.
* In **Active** write mode: it will answer users (_not staff!_) automatically when a relevant Knowledge Entry is found, and ignore (& log internally) otherwise.

If it doesn’t answer, see **[Troubleshooting](/resources/troubleshooting/)**.

> **Note**: community admins always need to explicitly prompt the bot, to avoid accidentally interrupting staff conversations.

---

## Done! What next?

* **Tune moderation & safety** → **[Spam & policy actions](/moderation/spam-detection/)**
* **Add more knowledge** (weekly) to improve coverage, and review the **[Unanswered Questions](/analytics/unanswered-questions/)**.
* **Review analytics** after a few days to find hot topics → **[Dashboards](/analytics/dashboards/)**
* **Connect more communities** or enable **Active** mode (paid) for hands-off answers.

---

## Common pitfalls & quick fixes

* **Two organizations:** use the org switcher (top-right), rename clearly, and leave the extra if you joined an existing team.
* **Verify not working:** re-add the bot, then regenerate a new `/verify <code>` and try again.
* **No answers:** either Write is set to *Passive* and you didn’t explicitly prompt, or there’s **no matching knowledge**. Add an entry and re-test with **✨**. Don't forget that even in *Active* mode, the bot ignores messages from staff if not explicitly prompted.
* **Permissions:** the bot must read + send in the target channel/group; in Discord also enable **Read Message History**.
